# Magnetically Actuated Capsule Control â€“ Reproduction of Pietro Valdastri's Work

This project is a reproduction of the work conducted by **Pietro Valdastri's research group**. It simulates the control of a robotic arm to drive a capsule using magnetic fields. The simulation environment enables users to experiment with **magnetic capsule manipulation** in a controlled setting.

## Installation Requirements

To run this simulation, the following software is required:

1. **MATLAB** (with the **Robotics System Toolbox**)  
   - Install the Robotics System Toolbox from:  
     [MathWorks Robotics System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html)
2. **CoppeliaSim** (formerly known as V-REP)  
   - Used for the simulation of the robotic arm and magnetic interaction.
  
## Usage

1. Open **CoppeliaSim** and run `akukamag_ipm.ttt`.  
2. In **MATLAB**, run `EndoCtl_ver1.m` to start the control process.
